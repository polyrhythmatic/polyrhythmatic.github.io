DETROIT

Serious economic downturn in the 80’s

Parents worked in the factory with robots. Increasing automation of car working industry

Empty city full of the artifacts of american industry

Techno - aspects of gospel, blues, disco, jazz, molded and deconstructed. Expression of dystopian condition

Juan Atkins - Hugely influencial, started much of the techno movement in Detroit and brought together all other artists.

UR captures the mystique of the city

Believe in technology as the savior for the black American underclass

DREXCIYA - James Stinson and Gerald Donald

"The Drexcyans are an underwater nation, the descendants of African women thrown overboard in the transatlantic slave trade.” Their children did not die, but could breath underwater.

Very mysterious, especially James Stinson. Emphasized the music over the personality. Emphasis on album art to accompany music
