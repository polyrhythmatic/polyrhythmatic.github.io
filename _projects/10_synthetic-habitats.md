Created as a part of my residency at Pioneer Works.

Synthetic Habitats is an exploration of the Macaulay Library of wildlife sounds, the worlds largest and oldest scientific archive of biodiversity audio and video recordings. By way of a multichannel sound installation, Synthetic Habitats seeks to address the scale and accessibility of information in the modern age by synthesizing wild habitats. At the same time, Synthetic Habitats serves to showcase the impressively expansive Macaulay Library and advocate for wildlife conservation. Participants are invited to explore the dynamic sound installation with the accompaniment of a mobile app which will allow them to explore the database and discover more about the sounds around them.

Video features binaural audio and is best listened to with headphones
